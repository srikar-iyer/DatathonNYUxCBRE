### Warehouse Construction Progress Prediction for CBRE (https://www.cbre.com/) as part of NYUxCBRE (https://nyudscdatathon2024.com/)
This project aims to predict the stage of progress of warehouses from aerial satellitery images using convolutional neural network (CNN) models and linear regression algorithms. The goal is to achieve between 70% to 60% accuracy in predicting warehouse progress stages and to estimate the number of quarters required for warehouse completion.

### Approach
### CNN Model Training:
Train CNN models to predict warehouse progress stages from satellite imagery.
Evaluate model performance using ground truth data.
Linear Regression Modeling:
Train linear regression algorithms to predict the number of quarters required for warehouse completion.
Use input parameters such as progress stages and square footage to predict completion timelines.
Integration and Prediction:
Combine predictions from CNN models and linear regression algorithms to estimate the total number of warehouses completed within a specific timeframe.
Provide insights into the progress of warehouse construction projects.

### Usage
Data Collection:
Gather satellite imagery of warehouses and relevant data such as square footage and progress stages.
Model Training:
Train CNN models using the collected data to predict progress stages.
Train linear regression algorithms to estimate the number of quarters required for completion.
Prediction:
Use trained models to predict warehouse progress stages and completion timelines.
Aggregate predictions to estimate the total number of completed warehouses within a given timeframe.
